# Cluster-Based Undersampling for Imbalanced Classification

This project applies the modified k-medoids based undersampling technique to handle imbalanced classification problems.

Majority class samples are clustered, and one representative sample is selected from each cluster (closest to the centroid). 
This helps reduce the imbalance while preserving data diversity.
